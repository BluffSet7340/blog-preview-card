## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I further reinforced my experience in CSS Flexbox, which also required me to learn how to optimally create div elements to place content inside of it. To ensure a proper fit for various screen sizes on desktop and mobile, I used media queries which reduced the width of the blog card to ensure that it stays withing the bounds of the width of the screen. I also made use of a :hover() pseudo-selector to add interactivity to the blog card.  

### Continued development

So the first challenge that I'm currenty facing is the preview on Github pages. I have uploaded all the necessary files and yet the avatar (bottom-left of the card) isn't showing up. When I use the Live Server extension on Visual Studio Code the avatar shows up just fine. Any suggestions are welcome. 

Another challenge was trying to line up the font size and style with that of the preview, especially regarding the "Learning" text and its associated box. I have used a font weight of 800 and I still wasn't able to replicate that of the preview. In the preview the "Learning" text looks more squeezed. Again, any suggestions are welcome. 

If there is a surefire method to figure out the font sizes, do let me know. In my case, I relied on using the 16px size font as stated in the guideline and then eyeballing the sizes of the other pieces of text.
